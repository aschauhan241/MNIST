# MNIST
applying different ML alogrithms on Mnist dataset.
There are three different notebooks 

	dimension reduction - In this we build a model using random forest classifier and than tested the time it took to make predictions.Then, we used pca to reduce the number of dimensions of dataset and used the same model.


	Ensemble - First, we used different classifiers and checked what their prediction values where, and then combined these classifiers in an Ensemble to create our model and checked result.

	SVM - We used SVM classifier and then compared its result with randomizedSearch Cv classifier with Svm model.
